<h2> Classification in Machine Learning </h2>
Introduction to models learned in supervised classification.

<h2> Dataset : </h2>
Iris is a dataset (set) introduced in 1936 by Ronald Aylmer Fisher as a example of discriminant analysis. This set contains 150 examples of criteria observed on different species of Gaspe iris (Setosa, Versicolor, Verginica). Each example is composed of four attributes (length and width of the sepals in cm, length and width of the petals in cm) and a class (the species).

<h2> Mission : </h2>
- Awareness of the evaluation of ML models learned in supervised classification. <br>
- Getting started with Python's scikit-learn library, dedicated to Machine Learning learning.

<h2>Naive Bayes Classifier : </h2>
Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.

<h2>Decision Tree Classifier : </h2>
The decision tree classifier creates the classification model by building a decision tree. Each node in the tree specifies a test on an attribute, each branch descending from that node corresponds to one of the possible values for that attribute.
